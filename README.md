# sc-SCENITH

Implementation of a pseudo-single cell metabolic calulation from flow cytometry data based on the SCENITH method, described by [Arg√ºello et al. (2020)
](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(20)30602-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413120306021%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). We perform a variation of the original protocol to include a barcoding step during the treatment with metabolic inhibitors, which allows the conditions to be pooled and processed together, thereby increasing the robustness of the results. The scheme below illustrates the barcoding process and how the different conditions are separated during the analysis.<br/>

<p align="justify">To generate single cell metabolic values, the FCS file obtained is pre-processed with FlowJo software and a dimensionality reduction is performed including all markers (except live/dead and CD45 markers, used for barcoding). Based on the assumption that similar cells cluster together, the metabolic parameters of one cell are infered from the puromycin values of its neighbouring cells. The Python script __name__ takes an FCS file, finds the K-nearest neighbours of each cell within a given radius and calculate its glucose and mitochondrial dependencies. In order to ensure both a minimum number of cells per calculation and reasonable metabolic values, additional quality controls are implemented. The following diagram provides a visual overview of the algorithm and the underlying calculations.</p><br/>
